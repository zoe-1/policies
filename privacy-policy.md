# Sideway Privacy Policy

Effective: September 17, 2016

Privacy is important. We respect yours. Our goal is to do more than we have to by law - we want to
earn your trust that we are careful with your data.

## General information

This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect
when you visit and use our sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content ("Services").

## What we may collect

We collect information about what Sideway pages you access, information about your mobile device
(such as device or browser type), information you share with us (such as an email address used to register
or communicate with us), and referral information.

When you use Sideway Services, we may collect and store your Internet Protocol address. We may use this
information to fight spam and other abuse; to personalize Sideway Services; or to generate aggregate,
non-identifying information about how people use Sideway Services.

When you create your Sideway account, and authenticate via a third-party service like Twitter or Facebook,
we may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that third-party account,
so you can connect with existing contacts from that service who are on Sideway.

## Email from Sideway

Sometimes we'll send administrative emails about account or service changes, or new policies. You cannot
opt out of them. You can always opt out of non-administrative emails such as daily digests. We won't email
you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, send it to us so
we can investigate.

## Disclosure of your information

As a rule, we don't share your personal information outside the company.

We won't sell your personal information.

We may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with
your consent; (2) to a vendor or partner who meets our data protection standards; or (3) when we have a
good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.

If we're going to share your information in response to legal process, we'll give you advance notice so
you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we're prohibited from doing so
by law or court order. We will object to requests for information about users of our site that we believe
to be improper.

If we merge with another company such that your information will become subject to a different privacy
policy, we'll notify you before the transfer. You can opt out of the new policy by deleting your account
during the notice period.

## Cookies

We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels and local storage to recognize you when you return
to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as
default language), evaluate email effectiveness, show relevant ads, and personalize information.

We currently do not support the Do Not Track ("DNT") settings in browsers.

Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser.
This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Sideway only and not the use of cookies by third parties.

## Data Storage

Sideway uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware, software, networking,
storage, and related technology we need to run Sideway. We maintain two types of logs: server logs and event
logs.

## Modifying your personal information or deleting your account

If you have a Sideway account, you can access and modify your personal information, or delete your account
by sending a request to [support@sideway.com](mailto:support@sideway.com).

To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may not immediately delete residual copies
from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

If you delete your account, your account and content may be unrecoverable.

## Data security

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission
over the Internet is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and
you are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (like using a strong password).

## Changes to this Policy

We can change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sideway/policies). If a change is material, we'll notify you on the Sideway
site before it take effect. By using Sideway on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms.
If you don't agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of
the site and content will be subject to the new Terms.

We welcome questions, concerns, and feedback about this policy at [support@sideway.com](mailto:support@sideway.com).
