These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a contract between you and Sideway Inc. They govern your use of
Sideway's sites, services, mobile apps, products, and content ("Services").

By using Sideway, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree to any of the Terms, you cannot use Sideway.

We can change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sideway/policies). If a change is material, we'll notify you on the Sideway
site before it take effect. By using Sideway on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms.
If you don't agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of
the site and content will be subject to the new Terms.

## Content rights & responsibilities

You own the rights to the content you create and post on Sideway.

By posting content to Sideway, you give us a nonexclusive license to publish it on Sideway Services,
including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and
distributing it). In consideration for Sideway granting you access to and use of the Services, you
agree that Sideway may enable advertising on the Services, including in connection with the display of
your content or other information. We may also use your content to promote Sideway, including its
products and content. We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.

By interacting with existing content on Sideway Services posted by other users (such as posting comments,
questions, or notes), you give the respective content owner a nonexclusive license to copy or modify
your contributions on Sideway Services and elsewhere.

You are responsible for the content you post. This means you assume all risks related to it, including
someone else's reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights.

You are welcome to post content on Sideway that you've published elsewhere, as long as you have the
rights you need to do so. By posting content to Sideway, you represent that doing so doesn't conflict
with any other agreement you've made.

By posting content you didn't create to Sideway, you are representing that you have the right to do so.
For example, you are posting a work that's in the public domain, used under license (including a free
license, such as Creative Commons), or a fair use.

We can remove any content you post for any reason.

You can delete any of your posts, or your account, at anytime. Processing the deletion may take a little
time, but we'll do it as quickly as possible. We may keep backup copies of your deleted post or account
on our servers for up to 30 days after you delete it. Comments or questions you post to other users'
content can only be deleted by the owner of that content once published.

We reserve all rights in Sideway's look and feel. Some parts of Sideway are licensed under third-party
open source licenses. We also make some of our own code available under open source licenses. As for
other parts of Sideway, you may not copy or adapt any portion of our code or visual design elements

You may not do, or try to do, the following: (1) access or tamper with non-public areas of the Services,
our computer systems, or the systems of our technical providers; (2) access or search the Services by
any means other than the currently available, published interfaces (e.g., APIs) that we provide;
(3) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or
in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information; or
