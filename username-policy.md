# Sideway Username Policy

Effective: September 17, 2016

Sideway usernames are claimed on a first-come, first-served basis. A username can only be attached
to one account at a time.

## Inactivity

We encourage you to remain active with your Sideway account. This activity can include commenting,
highlighting, or publishing. Accounts may be removed after 6 months of inactivity. We don't accept
requests for inactive accounts, unless you own a registered trademark for it.

## Trademarks

Username trademark violations may involve using a trademarked logo, business or product name in a
way likely to confuse people. For more information, read our
[Trademark Policy](https://github.com/sideway/policies/blob/master/trademark-policy.md).

## Parody Accounts

Sideway allows parody and fan accounts. Those accounts must be clearly marked as such, and need to
adhere to the following guidelines:

The bio must directly state that the account is not affiliated with the targeted subject by using
words such as "parody," "fake," "not," "false," or "fan." There's no specific formula you must use
for the disclaimer, but it must be quickly and clearly evident this is the intention of the account
to any audience.

The Sideway name and username must not be the exact same as the targeted subject, and should contain
a disclaiming word such as "parody," "fake," "not," "false," or "fan." For example, if you are
parodying John Smith, your username cannot be @johnsmith.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in suspension or removal of the Sideway account.

## Changes to this Policy

We can change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sideway/policies). If a change is material, we'll notify you on the Sideway
site before it take effect. By using Sideway on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms.
If you don't agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of
the site and content will be subject to the new Terms.
